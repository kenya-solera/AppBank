# AppBank

## Database connection

We have configured a mySQL database with this app. To run the app you will need to locally create this database.

Create a database called "appbank", and add a new user "Admin" with all privileges. Set the password for Admin to "Password1234*". Make sure your mySQL server is using port 3306. You can check all of these details on the application.properties file inside resources.  

If all this is set up properly, the app should run and do the rest. All the tables and fields will be filled out when you run the application. 

## Future improvements

- Security
- Make it pretty!
- More validation
- Testing

## Quick note on commits

Although we have all worked a little bit on everything, commits have mainly come from MariaÂ´s user for front-end changes, and Kenya's user for back-end. However, this is not fully represantive of the work done by each since we are sitting all together and collaborating constantly, often on the same computer.
