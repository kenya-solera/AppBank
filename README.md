# AppBank

We have worked on this for the whole day. Having more experience with backend, we have been successful at implementing the API.

We have also put a lot of work into the frontend part, although it is simpler given it was our first time doing anything like it. 

We are aware that there are many things missing: given, being able to successfully send HTTP requests from the frontend to the API to interact with the Database, 
as well as aesthetic changes.

Thank you.
